  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Slack integration, providing comprehensive workspace management capabilities through a modern API interface.

  ## Features
  - **Channel Management**: List, search, and interact with Slack channels
  - **Message Operations**: Send messages, search history, and manage threads
  - **User Management**: List, search, and send direct messages to users
  - **Advanced Search**: Powerful query-based message and channel filtering
  - **Thread Support**: Full thread management for both channels and DMs
  - **Markdown Support**: Automatic conversion of markdown to Slack format
  - **Typing Indicators**: Send typing events to channels and threads

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Slack Bot Token**: You'll need to create a Slack app and get a bot token

  ### How to create a Slack app and get your bot token:

  1. **Go to Slack API Console**
     - Visit [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
     - Click "Create New App"
     - Choose "From scratch"
     - Enter your app name and select your workspace

  2. **Configure Bot Token Scopes**
     - Go to "OAuth & Permissions" in the left sidebar
     - Under "Scopes" > "Bot Token Scopes", add these permissions:
       - `channels:history` - Read channel messages
       - `channels:read` - View basic channel info
       - `chat:write` - Send messages
       - `groups:history` - Read private channel messages
       - `groups:read` - View private channels
       - `im:history` - Read direct messages
       - `im:read` - View direct messages
       - `im:write` - Send direct messages
       - `mpim:history` - Read group DMs
       - `mpim:read` - View group DMs
       - `mpim:write` - Send group DMs
       - `users:read` - View users in workspace
       - `assistant:write` - Send typing indicators

  Note: You can configure the app to use the User Oauth token instead of the Bot token. The MCP server will use your user token to act as the user in your slack workspace. When doing this, you need to add User token Scopes to the app instead.

  If you are using the User Oauth token, you can add `search:read` to the User token Scopes to add ability to search messages in your workspace.

  3. **Install the App**
     - Go to "Install App" in the left sidebar
     - Click "Install to Workspace" to install this app into the workspace where you created this app
     - Authorize the app

  4. **Get Your Bot Token**
     - After installation, go back to "OAuth & Permissions"
     - Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)
     - This is your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

  5. **Environment Variable**
     - Set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` to your bot token value

  Note: You can also use the User Oauth token instead of the Bot token. The MCP server will use your user token to act as the user in your slack workspace.

  Note: If you are using the bot token, make sure the Bot is added to the slack channel if you want to send or get messages from the channel.
