  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets you interact with your Neon Postgres databases using natural language. Built on the Model Context Protocol, it acts as a bridge between natural language requests and the Neon API, enabling seamless database management without complex SQL or direct API calls.

  ## Features
  - **Natural Language Interaction**: Manage Neon databases using intuitive, conversational commands
  - **Project & Branch Management**: Create, delete, and manage Neon projects and branches with branching capabilities
  - **SQL Query Execution**: Run single queries or transactions with performance analysis and optimization
  - **Database Migrations**: Safe schema changes with temporary branch testing and rollback capabilities
  - **Performance Optimization**: Query tuning, execution plans, and slow query identification
  - **Accessibility**: Empowers users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with databases

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Required:**
  - **Neon Account**: Active Neon account (sign up at [console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech/signup))

  ## Example Usage

  - "Let's create a new Postgres database, and call it 'my-database'. Let's then create a table called users with columns: id, name, email, and password."
  - "I want to run a migration on my project 'my-project' that alters the users table to add a 'created_at' column."
  - "Can you give me a summary of all of my Neon projects and what data is in each one?"
