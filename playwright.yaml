name: Playwright
description: 'A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using Playwright. This server enables AI agents to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models for fast, deterministic automation.


  ## Features

  - **Accessibility-Based Automation**: Uses Playwright''s accessibility tree instead of pixel-based input for reliable automation

  - **LLM-Friendly Interface**: Operates purely on structured data without requiring vision models

  - **Core Web Interactions**: Click, type, navigate, drag, hover, and form interactions with precise element targeting

  - **Advanced Capabilities**: JavaScript evaluation, file uploads, dialog handling, and network monitoring

  - **Tab Management**: Multi-tab browser control with opening, closing, and switching between tabs

  - **Screenshot & PDF Generation**: Visual capture and document generation capabilities (with optional capabilities)

  - **Coordinate-Based Actions**: Precise mouse control with optional vision capabilities for complex interactions


  ## What you''ll need to connect


  **No Setup Required**: Playwright works out-of-the-box with no API keys or configuration needed.
