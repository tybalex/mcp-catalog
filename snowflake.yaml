description: |
  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive access to Snowflake data warehouse through multiple APIs. Manage Snowflake objects, execute SQL queries, and work with semantic views for advanced analytics and data management.

  ## Features
  - **Cortex Search**: Query unstructured data in Snowflake as commonly used in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications
  - **Cortex Analyst**: Query structured data in Snowflake via rich semantic modeling
  - **Object Management**: Perform basic operations against Snowflake's most common objects such as creation, dropping, updating, and more
  - **SQL Execution**: Run LLM-generated SQL managed by user-configured permissions
  - **Semantic View Querying**: Discover and query Snowflake Semantic Views and their components

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Required:**
  - **Snowflake Account**: Your Snowflake account identifier
  - **Username**: Your Snowflake username
  - **Password**: Your Snowflake password

  **Optional:**
  - **Role**: Your Snowflake role (e.g., ACCOUNTADMIN, SYSADMIN)
  - **Snowflake Host**: Your Snowflake host URL
  - **Service Config YAML**: YAML configuration for service managers and SQL statement permissions
