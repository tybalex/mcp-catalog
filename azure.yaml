  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that implements the MCP specification to create a seamless connection between AI agents and Azure services. Supercharge your agents with Azure context across compute, storage, databases, AI services, and more.

  ## Features
  - **Azure AI & Search**: Query Azure AI Search indexes and manage search services
  - **Data Services**: Cosmos DB, SQL Database, PostgreSQL, Redis Cache, and Data Explorer operations
  - **Compute & Containers**: AKS cluster management and container operations
  - **Storage & Configuration**: Azure Storage, App Configuration, and Key Vault management
  - **Monitoring & Analytics**: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Grafana, and Workbooks
  - **CLI Integration**: Execute Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI commands directly
  - **Resource Management**: Manage subscriptions, resource groups, and RBAC

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Authentication:**
  You will need to set the following environment variables:
  - AZURE_TENANT_ID
  - AZURE_CLIENT_ID
  - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
  These must correspond to a service principal. You can create one using the (Azure web console)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal], or with the Azure CLI:

  ```bash
  az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<my-service-principal>" --role contributor \
  --scopes /subscriptions/<your-subscription-id> \
  --query "{AZURE_CLIENT_ID: appId, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: password, AZURE_TENANT_ID: tenant}" --output json
  ```

  Replace `<my-service-principal>` with the name of the service principal you want to create, and `<your-subscription-id>` with your actual subscription ID. The role you assign to the service principal will determine the permissions it has.

  **Optional Configuration:**
  - **AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY** (Optional): Set to `false` to opt out of telemetry collection (default: `true`)

  ## Examples
  - **Azure AI Search**: "What indexes do I have in my Azure AI Search service 'mysvc'?"
  - **App Configuration**: "List my App Configuration stores"
  - **AKS**: "List my AKS clusters in my subscription"
  - **Cosmos DB**: "Show me all my Cosmos DB databases"
  - **Data Explorer**: "Sample 10 rows from table 'StormEvents' in Azure Data Explorer database 'db1'"
  - **Storage**: "List my Azure storage accounts"
  - **Monitor**: "Query my Log Analytics workspace"
  - **Resource Management**: "List my resource groups"
