  > [!CAUTION]
  > **WARNING: this MCP server is EXPERIMENTAL.**

  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects to your Elasticsearch data directly from any MCP Client. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store and vector database optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads.

  ## Features
  - **Index Management**: List all available Elasticsearch indices and get field mappings
  - **Search Capabilities**: Perform Elasticsearch searches with query DSL and ES|QL queries
  - **Vector Search**: Enable vector search for AI applications and RAG implementations
  - **Shard Information**: Get detailed shard information for indices
  - **Full-text Search**: Search across massive datasets in near real-time
  - **Analytics**: Support for logs, metrics, APM, and security logs

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Required:**
  - **ES URL**: Your Elasticsearch instance URL

  **Authentication (choose one method):**
  - **Option 1 - API Key (Recommended)**: `ES API Key`
  - **Option 2 - Username/Password**: `ES Username` and `ES Password`

  **Prerequisites:**
  - An Elasticsearch instance (versions 8.x and 9.x officially supported)
  - Elasticsearch authentication credentials

  **Note**: If both authentication methods are provided, API key takes precedence.

  ## Known Issues

  GPT-4.1 is generally not able to format its API requests correctly when calling the `search` tool.
  Claude Sonnet 4 works better.
