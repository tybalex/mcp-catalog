  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for deep SQL performance analysis and optimization. It delivers advanced index tuning, workload-aware query insights, safe execution controls, and schema-aware SQL generation—backed by comprehensive database health diagnostics and EXPLAIN plan simulation.


  ## Features

  - **Database Health Analysis**: Comprehensive health checks including index health, connection utilization, buffer cache analysis, vacuum health, and replication lag monitoring

  - **Advanced Index Tuning**: Industrial-strength algorithms that explore thousands of possible indexes using proven optimization techniques

  - **Query Performance Optimization**: EXPLAIN plan analysis and hypothetical index simulation for performance validation

  - **Schema Intelligence**: Context-aware SQL generation based on detailed database schema understanding

  - **Safe SQL Execution**: Configurable access control with read-only mode and SQL parsing for both development and production environments

  - **Workload Analysis**: Identify resource-intensive queries and get targeted optimization recommendations


  ## What you''ll need to connect


  **Required:**

  - **Database URI**: PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname`)


  ## Example Usage


  - "Check the health of my database and identify any issues"

  - "What are the slowest queries in my database? And how can I speed them up?"

  - "Analyze my database workload and suggest indexes to improve performance"

  - "Help me optimize this query: SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id WHERE orders.created_at > ''2023-01-01''"


  ## Known Issues


  Some tools require extensions to be installed in the target postgres instance:

  - `get_top_queries` requires the `pg_stat_statements` extension

  - `analyze_workload_indexes` and `analyze_query_indexes` require the `hypopg` extension
