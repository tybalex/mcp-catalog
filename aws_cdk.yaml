toolPreview:
- name: CDKGeneralGuidance
  description: Use this tool to get prescriptive CDK advice for building applications on AWS.
  params: {}
- name: ExplainCDKNagRule
  description: Explain a specific CDK Nag rule with AWS Well-Architected guidance. CDK Nag is a crucial tool for ensuring your CDK applications follow AWS security best practices.
  params:
    rule_id: The CDK Nag rule ID (e.g., 'AwsSolutions-IAM4')
- name: CheckCDKNagSuppressions
  description: Check if CDK code contains Nag suppressions that require human review. Scans TypeScript/JavaScript code for NagSuppressions usage to ensure security suppressions receive proper human oversight and justification.
  params:
    code: CDK code to analyze (TypeScript/JavaScript) (optional)
    file_path: Path to a file containing CDK code to analyze (optional)
- name: GenerateBedrockAgentSchema
  description: Generate OpenAPI schema for Bedrock Agent Action Groups from a file. This tool converts a Lambda file with BedrockAgentResolver into a Bedrock-compatible OpenAPI schema.
  params:
    lambda_code_path: Path to Python file containing BedrockAgentResolver app
